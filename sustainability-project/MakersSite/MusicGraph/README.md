# MusicGraph
What kind of music do I listen to?
TODO:
For now, have a version that is both spark dependant and not- 
spark's Graphx seems to only have a Scala API-not ideal with my data set

write code that takes:
Music1 -> Genre1
then adds edges to all Musics that have Genre1
Music2-> Genre1
Music1 -> Music2

webscrape for a tree that adds connectivity of music genre's and try to relate them
look on wikipedia:
folk rock has three parents, folk , rock, blues
folk rock has several children such as celtic rock, folk metal
folk rock as siblings and other relations such as country and soft rock, that as spin-offs

use tree toremove ambuguity with latin and latin jazz

debate relavance of tags that say '60s and '70s, which make sense in Petula Clark and Tom Jones, 
may not be relevant for Stevie Wonder

Determine relevancy of tags that are countries, UK may be important for Beatles, but not Queen

fix problems with sertain tags a capella not being recognized to be the same as acapella, can this be fixed with
the relational tree, look at disabaguations maybe

possibly looking igraph or cytograph, note that if you are reading this after it's compleation, 
cytograph requires to be sourced
